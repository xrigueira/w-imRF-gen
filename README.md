 Generalized iterative multiresolution Random Forest for anomaly discovery and explanation.

 ### Results
 In summary, the generalized model demonstrates strong performance in anomaly detection tasks but lacks explainability potential. Its reliance primarily on ammonium as the key driving factor diminishes the significance of other variables in decision paths. Consequently, the XAI plots primarily reflect the importance of ammonium learned during training, neglecting the relevance of other variables. This presents a significant flaw as anomalies often exhibit multivariate behavior.
